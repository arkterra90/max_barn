        <h2 class="mb-3">OPTIONS</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-2">WINDOWS</h3>
        <p>Double pane, single-hung white vinyl windows with grids in 3x3, 3x4, and 3x5 (or we can use yours) installed in 2x6 boxes for easier trimming.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-2">WALK DOORS</h3>
        <p>Steel 36 primed raised pane (including knob and deadbolt) with rot-free composite lower frame trimmed to cover all wood (or we can use yours).</p>

        <h3 class="mb-2">OVERHEAD DOORS</h3>
        <p>Standard raised panel insulated door in black or white (openers can be added later). Carriage style, commercial, and windows are options. Must be 2' shorter than sidewall.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-2">LEAN TO SHEDS/PORCHES</h3>
        <p>Flatten the pitch slightly and extend the roof up to 19' if sidewall height allows. Standard porches include a soldier course of metal on the front, open underneath, and angled ends covered in trim.</p>
        <p>Ceilings, squared ends, lowered, and concrete are options.</p>

        <!-- Additional information starts here -->

        <h2 class="mb-3">ADDITIONAL OPTIONS</h2>
        <h3 class="mb-2">WAINSCOTTING</h3>
        <p>Use a separate color for the bottom 3 or 4 feet of your building for an accent.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-2">SOFFIT</h3>
        <p>Extend the roof by one foot on all sides and cover the bottom with solid and perforated soffit material in any color.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-2">SCISSOR TRUSSES</h3>
        <p>Adds a slight interior vault for a unique architectural touch.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-2">POST SLEEVES</h3>
        <p>Hard plastic 5" sleeves prevent post-ground contact, providing added protection and longevity.</p>

        <h3 class="mb-2">ROOF EXTENSIONS</h3>
        <p>Trusses can be extended in 5-inch increments on each gable end (requires a ceiling to seal).</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3">ORDER OF EVENTS</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Text your name and build address to 918-688-6136. We will make a building available for you to view.</li>
            <li>We will visit with you at the site to establish grade, get specifics, and offer a color chart. If the site is unlevel by more than 18", a pad must be provided 3' larger than the size on all sides.</li>
            <li>A basic road is needed for materials and concrete.</li>
            <li>A contract and drawing will be sent. Review all details and verify that your window and door placements are planned around posts. The price listed ONLY includes one load of screenings for leveling. You are responsible for additional fill for grading.</li>
            <li>OK plans and details and prepare to pay 50% of the price at this time, and delivery will be scheduled. Builder's risk should be in place to cover theft or damage.</li>
            <li>We will assist in permitting. A state-approved septic layout (unless you have city sewer) is required before a permit if plumbing is involved.</li>
            <li>We frame the building first, grade it closely, allow any rough-in plumbing, finish grade and pour, and then install windows and doors with insulation and metal. The process usually takes 2-3 weeks. We will clean up and remove all trash. Materials remaining were ordered extra and will be removed.</li>
            <li>Final payment is expected IMMEDIATELY after completion. Make arrangements if drawing on a loan. Additional charges may include fill, added items, towing if needed, and jackhammering post holes if necessary.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mb-3">AFTER COMPLETION</h2>
        <p>Concrete takes a month to completely cure. Allow air flow until the floor is dry. You can walk on the floor immediately but do not drive for the first week.</p>
        <p>We will offer framing tips if asked.</p>
